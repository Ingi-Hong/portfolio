# Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Ingi. 

I'm a senior at Boston University studying computer science. Currently I'm working at [BU Spark!](https://www.bu.edu/spark/) to build full stack web applications using technologies like Next.js. 

Recently I've been building out an web app to filter educational chess content @ [chesstube.app](https://www.chesstube.app). Check it out, and if you would like to contribute please feel free to contact me.
