# Projects

## Chesstube.app 

Recently I've been building out a web app to filter educational chess content @ [chesstube.app](https://www.chesstube.app). Check it out, and if you would like to contribute please feel free to contact me. 

## Where's everything else? 

My other personal projects can be found at my [github](https://github.com/Ingi-Hong). I built these minis to learn new technologies. 

# Work

## Trimble Maps 

I'm currently working as a full stack engineer with Trimble, working on React frontends and Java microservices. 

## BU Spark! 

I built data dashboards and web applications for BU Spark!'s clients while I was attending Boston University.
